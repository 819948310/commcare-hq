        Most styling should live in external LESS files.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most HQ-specific styling lives in external LESS files, typically in
        <code>corehq/apps/hqwebapp/static/hqwebapp/less</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        App-specific styling
        can live in <code>corehq/apps/style/static/APPNAME/less</code> and then be
        included with <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tags in the appropriate template.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some pages use in-page <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> blocks. This isn't ideal for two reasons:
        <ul>
            <li>In-page styles can't be reused by other pages - but for the sake of a consistent experience,
            most styling shouldn't be specific to a single page.</li>
            <li>In-page styles can't use LESS, so they tend to be less DRY and has to hard-code values like
            colors and dimensions, rather than using the standard values stored in LESS.</li>
        </ul>
        Inline styling is generally a bad idea for the same reasons as in-page styling: one-off styling
        isn't good for consistency and often isn't semantic.
